The game engine is responsible to update the game state.

The "/admin/prepare-engine" service runs every 10 minutes via CRON.
Its only purpose is to look if any challenges start in the next 10 minutes, and if yes add a new task to the queue.

The "/admin/run-engine" runs every one second, while the challenge is active. It generates the following two outputs:
1. the roster (active players, names, avatars, colors)
2. the leaderboard (including player statistics etc.)
3. the game state (player positions, and directions)

Perhaps we can limit the amount of time allocated to each task using something like in this answer:
