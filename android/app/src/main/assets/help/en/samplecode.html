<h1>Sample code</h1>

<p>There are four sample codes which you can use to learn how to write code and see how the game works.
    In this example we will look at the Left Wall Follower algorithm.
</p>

<p>The left wall follower is a basic maze-solving algorithm which is based on keeping one 'hand' on the left wall at all times.
    In simplest terms the avatar will turn counter-clockwise (left) if it can, otherwise it will keep moving forward.
    Eventually, it will reach the end given that all of the walls in the maze are connected.

<p>In the sample code provided, the justTurned variable is initialized to false and is used so that the avatar will
remember if it has made a turn in the last round.</p>
